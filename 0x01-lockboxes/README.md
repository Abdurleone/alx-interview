# Lockboxes Interview Project

## Overview

The Lockboxes project is designed to evaluate your problem-solving and coding skills through a series of tasks related to lockboxes and access control systems. This README provides an overview of the project, including setup instructions, the main task, and how to run tests.

## Main Task

You are required to implement a function that simulates a lockbox system. The lockboxes are represented as a list of strings, where each string contains the state of the lockbox. Your goal is to implement a function to determine if all lockboxes can be opened, given certain constraints and operations.

### Example

**Input:**
```json
["000", "111", "010"]
```

**Output:**
```json
True
```

**Explanation:**
In this example, you can start with the first lockbox (index 0) and unlock the other lockboxes by following the specified rules.

## Requirements

- Implement a function that determines if all lockboxes can be opened.
- Ensure that the function handles edge cases and performs efficiently.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running Tests

1. To run the tests, use the following command:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

2. To lint the code and check for style issues, use:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

## Usage

- Implement your solution in the provided function within `src/lockboxes.js`.
- Add any additional helper functions as needed.
- Make sure to write tests to verify your solution.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request. Ensure that your code adheres to the project's coding standards and includes adequate tests.
